# Copilot code review: Customization for all

![](https://github.blog/wp-content/themes/github-2021-child/assets/img/featured-v3-new-releases.svg)

## Summary

Copilot code review now supports the same custom instructions used by Copilot Chat and coding agent‚Äîunlocking personalized, consistent AI reviews across your workflow.

You can now tailor **Copilot code review** using `.github/copilot-instructions.md`‚Äîthe same customization file already used by **Copilot Chat** and **Copilot coding agent**. This brings a consistent way to shape how Copilot responds across your entire workflow.

‚ú® **Support is in public preview for all paid Copilot users.**

Just add a `copilot-instructions.md` file in your repository and add natural language instructions. A few ideas:

-   üåç _‚ÄúRespond in Spanish‚Äù_ (for multilingual teams)
-   üßπ _‚ÄúFocus on readability and avoid nested ternaries‚Äù_ (for style-conscious reviews)
-   üì¶ _‚ÄúPrioritize feedback on our public APIs‚Äù_ (to flag high-risk changes)

Check out this example, now in Spanish:

Once configured, your instructions will be applied automatically‚Äîno manual setup required per pull request.

For business and enterprise customers, make sure your organization administrator opts in to [Copilot preview features](https://docs.github.com/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization#:~:text=Opt%20in%20to%20preview%20features%3A%20If%20enabled%2C%20users%20can%20test%20new%20Copilot%20features%20that%20are%20not%20yet%20generally%20available.%20Be%20aware%20that%20previews%20of%20features%20may%20have%20flaws%2C%20and%20the%20features%20may%20be%20changed%20or%20discontinued%20at%20any%20time.%20Current%20previews%20of%20Copilot%20features%20include%3A) to access this functionality.

Coming soon: To manage this behavior, head to your repository settings under Copilot code review.
